## SPACE BATTLES README
Welcome to Space Battles, the coolest game in the galaxy! Shoot your enemy, and control the bullets with the power of the force!\
This game is the RST for my Grade 11 Intro to Computer Science class. The objective of the game is to chase around and shoot the other spaceship 10 times to kill them and win.

# Backstory
For millenia, Redtopia and Yellowville have been in constant discord. This war has caused the entire galaxy to be in unrest and terror. Leading up to the events of the game, 
a nuclear catastrophe decimated both armies in the field. Now, only one commander from each army remains. It is up to the players to win this battle and finally obtain peace 
in the universe. Unknown to them, the nuclear fallout caused a rip in the space-time continuum, leading them to fight for eternity, unable to be killed for good.

# Controls
These are the controls for the **red spaceship** (on the left):\
WASD = Move\
Q = Shoot\
E = Left Rotate\
R = Right Rotate

These are the controls for the **yellow spaceship** (on the right:\

RALT = Left Rotate\
RCTRL = Right Rotate

# Inspiration
Since we had no previous experience making games with Pygame, we decided to follow a beginner Pygame tutorial that we found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY). 
We're both fans of space invaders, so we decided to go with something space related. Then, we decided to change some things about the game 
to make it cooler and more unique instead of a straight copy of the tutorial. Some things we changed were the border in the middle, so that 
the players can chase each other around. We also allowed the players to rotate, so that they can change directions. Additionally, the player
can control the trajectory of the bullets using “the force”. This was inspired by Star Wars, since the flying spaceships reminded us of the movie. 
Also, we created a main menu screen with the objective of the game and controls. This makes it easier for the player to learn how to play. 
Another thing is that we added background music and imported a better background image.

We got ideas from several tutorials to be able to learn how to use Pygame and implement the features we wanted.\
